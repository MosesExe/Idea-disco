# Why Python?

I always wanted to do it, and all the other programmers parental units let them do it so I want to as well. Also Python is like SUPER flexible for random ideas I like between this JS, and like one major OO Language, and you've got every Full-Stack devs basic toolkit, and some of my tools need some grease.

### P1: License to Hex

I came up with this idea once while stuck in traffic and trying to keep myself sane. Converting strings to License Plates to numerical or alphabetical patterns is something I do for fun. I was wondering how I could make that in a program and it's pretty simple, but then I wanted to do more because it was so simple.

I can't call it a cypher [Not in good concious anyway, those usually are a lot more technical so I guess this could be babies first cypher] so it's more just a basic conversion thing. I finalized on an idea of going from input -> user choice/random/opposite -> HEX.
