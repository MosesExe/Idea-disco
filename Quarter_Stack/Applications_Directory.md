# What's a Quarter Stack?

It's my insane way of saying make a local web application with the idea that it'll show off my full-stack skills while keeping it in a local directory.

[P1: Insurance Website](#p1-medical-insurance-website)

[P2: DnD Character Builder](#p1:-dnd-character-builder)

### P1: Medical Insurance Website

This is based off of a unfinished project I tried to build during my junior year in college. The insurance site would track: Appointments made through insurance agents on the site, or claims made through the actual site itself:

- Option 1: Single Page Application where everything exist on one page including claims and a calender at the top.

- Option 2: Multi-Page Application that has a page dedicated to each function.

### P2: DnD Character Builder

So the idea is one I got from reading the dnd 5e API for the default classes that exist in the PHB I want to do that, but this time I want to make an API for the custom classes on hand in the future.

Ex:

- Option 1: Random Character- Generates an entire file with keys and values assigned then those get made and attached.
- Option 2: Get a few predefined values (Class, Race, Name) and generate the rest.

Both ask how the stats should be decided:

1. 4d6  
2. Standard Array
